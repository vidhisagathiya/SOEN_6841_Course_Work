This repository serves as a centralized hub for my coursework, where I document my weekly learning journey through detailed journals. Each entry provides insights into the activities undertaken, reflections on the learning process, and areas for personal growth. By maintaining this repository, I aim to foster a reflective learning environment while demonstrating my commitment to self-directed learning and academic excellence.
